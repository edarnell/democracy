Project to deliver true democracy

Our democratic systems are archaic, non-democratic and are fuelling extremism and ecological destruction. 
We need a system designed for the 21st not the 18th century.

If you would like to help please feel free to join the team.

Design goals:

The aim is to build a system which enables the electorate to democratically suggest, review, prioritise, refine and implement ideas for themselves. The electorate rather than politicians take full control of taxation, investment and laws.

The system must help mitigate against the primary problem with our current democratic systems, namely:

1) Weaknesses in human thought patterns, leading to logic errors and known cognitive biases.
2) Un-democratic manipulation by those with power through money and marketing (generally spinning emotion based half-truths which manipulate the above).

A suggested initial approach which may evolve.

For 1) subject ideas to scientific review, to ensure they are founded on evidence not spin.

For 2) do not allow any marketing. Send ideas for review to a random sample and only circulate ideas for wider review which pass the test.

I'll start building an initial version but feel free to help.

Work in progress will be hosted at http://agilegov.uk (feel free to set up your own version elsewhere if you are not part of the UK electorate).
It would be nice to fix democracy across the planet not just in the UK, although there is an urgent need to fix our achaic UK system.
